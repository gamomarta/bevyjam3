    <b>OUTBREAK!!!</b><br>
    People with a mild fungal infection are running towards the hospital.<br>
    If they get there, they will infect people, and if everyone is sick, they will sneeze for a few days, and that's a losing condition if I ever saw one.<br>
    Place well-trained doctors armed with experimental pills to <strike>kill</strike> gently treat the infected. But watch out, every medicine has its side effects.
